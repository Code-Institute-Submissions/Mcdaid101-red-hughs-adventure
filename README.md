## How to play
* This game is constructed like a traditional text adventure game where the player is asked to input what direction he would like to head. 

* For example head north for kitchen, head south for bedroom and head east for bathroom.

* Once the desired input is entered the player will arrive there and be allowed to return to previous locations with items picked up from other ones.

* Items acquired through visiting new locations and solving puzzles are vital to the player's progress and will allow he/she to escape and complete the game. 

* If a player is caught or killed by the guards he will fail the game and be offered another attempt.
